# You are great!

## Project information

Especially in those times, it is important to not completely sink into negative thoughts, which can be very hard some
days.
This small Python script displays positive phrases in a randcmized order. The displayed sentence changes every five
minutes. Give it a try, let it run alongside your other applications, look at it sometimes. Of course, no success
can be guaranteed, but it will most likely not cause any harm.

## Technical details
The script needs Python 3.6 or above to run. It is a command line / terminal application.

## Cooperation / Collaboration
You can contribute to the project if you feel like it. In this case, you agree that your contributions will become
part of the MIT license. Feel free to make PRs.
Possible tasks:
* Add support for other languages.
* Add command line params for more options.
* Add new positive affirmations! The pool of possible sentences is still small.
